# INT 104
## Overview
### Learning Outcomes in Plain Language
- General aims
    - A sense of AI
    - How AI works
    - Use AI to solve simple problems
- Advanced aims (optional)
    - Understand math behind algorithms
    - Use AI to solve more complex tasks such as multimedia content analysis
    - Develop AI systems
    - Develop new AI algorithms
### Challange
- Insufficient data
- Nonrepresentative Training Data
- Poor data quality
- Irrelevant Features
- Overfitting
- Underfitting
- Data Mismatch (Data Domain)
### Label Needed
- Supervised Learning: use label to let model know and learn

- Self-supervised Learning: label data itself, like GPT or similar LLMs


### Basic Types
- Regression
    - Linear Regression
    - Non-linear Regression
